# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a web-based interactive memory game that challenges users to follow and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts by flashing one button . Each round, the sequence grows longer, and the player must correctly repeat the entire sequence to progress. A wrong click ends the game and prompts the player to restart.
